<h3 id="graston_technique">The Graston Technique&reg; For Scars, Adhesions and Muscle Injuries</h3>
<p>
  Linda Davis, OTR/L recently completed Graston Technique&reg; (GT) and is now treating patients with GT at Total Rehab.
</p>
<p>
  The Technique uses specially designed stainless steel instruments to detect and treat areas exhibiting scar tissue or chronic inflammation.
</p>
<p>
  Clinicians use the instruments with varying shapes to comb over and "catch" on fibrotic tissue, which immediately identifies areas of restriction. Once the tissue has been identified, the instruments break up scar tissue so the body can absorb it.
</p>
<p>
  The Technique reduces pain and increases range of motion. It also:
  <ul>
    <li>Improves diagnostic treatment</li>
    <li>Increases patient satisfaction by achieving notably better outcomes</li>
    <li>Speeds rehabilitation and recovery</li>
    <li>Reduces the need for anti-inflammatory medication</li>
    <li>Allows the patient to continue to engage in everyday activities.</li>
  </ul>
